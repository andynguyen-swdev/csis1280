                        Contrasting with the cold atmosphere of Beijing, Shanghai has a dynamic vibe
                        similar to that of Hong Kong. After all, it's not a political center but a trade center. It's a
                        lovely place if you are rich and have a lot of money to spend,
                        unlike me (insert sad emoji here). Ultimately all I could do is window shopping. I also visited
                        a
                        temple with a lot of
                        cats chlling inside. If only our lives were so comfortable.

                        Beijing - or Peking - the capital of People's Repulbic of China - the most populous capital in
                        the
                        world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing" target="_blank" class="cite">(source)</a>
                        -
                        the city where the Forbidden City is located at - the place where people seem a bit cold
                        although
                        it's very hot in the summer. Climbing the Great Wall was a remarkable experience. It took one
                        hell
                        of an effort for me to get through 3 posts, which is not even <em>one thousandth</em> of the
                        total.

                        The main reason that I went to Bangkok for was BTS's concert. If you don't know about this band
                        then
                        you must have been living under the rock for the last few years (or you haven't been in East
                        Asia).
                        There were so many people going to this concert that I had trouble
                        getting to the stadium where it was hosted. The traffic jam was so bad that I had to walk on my
                        feet
                        for an hour each way. The concert was dope nonetheless.
